                    Last time in Kogendia ×
                    Arelia was summoned to parts unknown by a mysterious bird, while our heroes 
                    prepared for the journey to Misrey. Before the sun set, the band of adventurers 
                    were summoned by Rolend, the Banking Guild's representative, to equip our heroes 
                    with banking cards, sealed with their blood. Resting for the night at the Goodly 
                    Ranger after being equipped with silver weapons. 
                    
                    On the bridge crossing the river to Misrey, our band was ambushed by a cyclops. 
                    The battle was ferocious, but wit, cunning, and healing potions won out in the end. 
                    Following the giant's foot prints, the lair and treasure was found, leaving our heroes 
                    with a king's ransom in gold, silver, and gems, as well as a pair of magic gloves and 
                    stringed instrument. 
                    After filling the bag of holding with loot, we finally arrived in Misrey. Ufear went to 
                    meet his contract, while Durk and Mia found lodging for the night and had the Gloves of 
                    Swimming and Climing and the Citern of the Bards appraised. When Ufear made it to the 
                    stables, it was clear this shipment was extraordinary.
                    A 5×5×5 foot crate had been loaded onto the borrowed wagon, strapped with iron reinforced 
                    bands. Shifts were taken to watch over the crate til morning. Departing early, after buying 
                    a wagon cover, our heroes set course for Dellurme. However, on the night of the second day, 
                    the crate started to thrash about. Arcane runes shone brightly, trying to contain the creature 
                    inside, but part of the crate burst open, revealing snakelike skin of a bound monster inside...
                    "Who the fuck are your friends?!?" 
                    Mia screamed to Ufear.

                    A messenger arrived at the gates of the keep. After delivering his message, 
                    the courtier exploded, knocking Ivar into a coma, and covering the courtyard in 
                    viscera. The script matched the previous letters we had found. A map pointed us 
                    to a location to the south; an abandoned compound with an asylum in the center. 
                    All manner of horror waited for our heroes.

                <p class="mb-4"> 
                    Delving into the ruin, the area seemed strange. Discovering a number of secret 
                    doors allowed exploration, but did not prepare the party for the horrid creatures 
                    within. Scorpions, crafted of human bodies, guarded the inner sanctum. Destroying 
                    the monsters, our heroes discovered the vampire's resting place - empty. Once Ivar 
                    recovers, the report can be submitted. -Sam "Durk" Tuck

                        A new face arrived at the gates of the keep. A cleric called Herbert, 
                        who was initially skeptical about our cause. After visiting town and 
                        seeing the mayor firsthand, Herbert joined our cause. However, the present 
                        situation became more unsettling when Inquisitor Peter arrived in the morning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> 
                        "All charges against you have been dropped," he said. Inquisitor Peter asked to 
                        speak with commander Ivar, in private. The mayor's body went missing. The guards 
                        who were watching over the body were brutalized - one missing. The vampire hunter's 
                        grandson.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        After deciding to acquire his trunk of hunter's equipment, we headed back to the 
                        profane dungeon. It had been cleared of some of the rubble. The deeper we descended 
                        into the hellish halls, blood was thick enough to taste. Deeper into the heart of the 
                        place, we found the grandson - torn apart and painting a room. Though, the silver key 
                        of his grandfather remained. After retrieving the key, we left the place as quickly as 
                        possible. Returning to the keep, we opened up the trunk, to find hunting supplies - 
                        silver cord, silver daggers, silver bolts, holy water, stakes, and more. Now, our heroes 
                        are armed for the quest ahead.-Sam "Durk" Tuck

                        The heroes collapse the profane ruins, and carry the mayor to safety. However, he died 
                        en rout to the keep. Without delay, his body is brought to Commander Ivar - who just 
                        finished a meeting with the mayor. Now, the mystery thickens. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4"> 
                        With a charge from Commander Ivar, the heroes go to Honnestad and confront the 'mayor'. 
                        In a flash, the creature changes into the mayor's secretary, before fleeing. After capturing 
                        the creature, we bring it back to the keep. Accompanied by the village, we searched for some 
                        clue to show the truth, but our efforts were thwarted, when the creature escaped.

                        Delving into the violated ruins, our heroes faced many undead horrors. Droves of zombies, were-rats, 
                        stitched owl bears, and golems sewn of men's bodies. In the bowels of the dungeon, we found the Mayor 
                        of Honnestad, with vampiric puncture wounds on his neck. Taking time to recover from many close fights, 
                        we resume here.

                        Our intrepid heroes spent some time learning about Honnestad. Commander Ivar is away for a couple of days, 
                        yet something about the town of roughly 700 isn't quite right. With a cloaked figure leaving a cryptic message, 
                        our heroes head west, to a ruined building that reeks of evil.

                        Descending into the cellar of this place, our party finds themselves in a den of murder. Zombies seem to be the
